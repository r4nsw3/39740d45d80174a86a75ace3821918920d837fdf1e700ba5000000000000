  |   - Issues Fixed                                                        |
  |    - The issue where the Pokémon received through Mystery Gift does     |
  |    not get registered in the Pokédex when exiting the game without      |
  |    saving has been resolved.                                            |
  |                                                                         |
  |    - If you have already received the Pokémon through Mystery Gift,     |
  |    put the Pokémon that is not registered in the Pokédex in the         |
  |    Pokémon Box and download the update data. Once this is done,         |
  |    the Pokémon should be reflected in the Pokédex.                      |
  |                                                                         |
